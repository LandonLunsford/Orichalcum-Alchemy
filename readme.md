Orichalcum-Alchemy
==================
A Truly Magical IoC Assistant!
<br>

### Backgound

Originally created as an internal IoC solution for Orichalcum Studios --
<br>
Its creator, Landon Lunsford, has decided to make it available for the AS3 developer community
<br>
free of charge under the MIT License.
<br>

### Coming Soon
1. Add PooledInstanceProvider
2. Add delegation to IProvider for object destruction (this allows pools to be implemented) --> update xml&json schema
3. Possibly add "Profile" object to house recipes & providers mapped to Id's and instances
3. Migrate XML/JSON config file readers to configure your alchemist in a way not seen in any other AS3 IoC solution
4. User guide
